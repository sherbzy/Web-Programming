		<h2>Here are some fun facts:</h2>
	
		<p> Did you know that the <abbr title="Pirates of the Caribbbean">POTC</abbr> movies were based on the Disneyland and
		Walt Disney World ride? The movies consistantly pulled sound effects and scenes that originate from the ride. The
		ride, which was the <strong>largest audio-animatronic project to date</strong>, first opened in 1973 at Disneyland in
		California. The pirates of the caribbean ride was also the last attraction with design involvement from Walt Disney.</p>
		<br>
		
		
		<p> There are <del>five</del> <ins>six</ins> movies in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. What many people do not
		know is that there is a short film called <i>Tales of the Code: Wedlocked</i> that serves as a prequel to <i>Pirates
		of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl</i>. The movies were released in 2003, 2006, 2007, 2011, 2011, &#38; 2017
		respectively. Although the pirates in the movies are based on historical facts, the character of Jack Sparrow is a
		combination of several different pirates that were popular in the 1700s. The famous 'Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A Pirates Life For
		Me!' song was written by Xavier Atencio. This is the order in which to watch the POTC movies:</p>
