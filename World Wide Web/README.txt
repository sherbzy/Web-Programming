World Wide Web Module
Note: this module was about going over the basics and did not include a coding project


WWW Learning Goals
    1. What URL stands for
        ◦ Uniform Resource Locator
    2. The parts of a URL: Protocol, Subdomain, Domain, Path, Query & Parameters
        ◦ protocol – specifies the structure for communication between a client and server
        ◦ subdomain – smaller units that make up domains; often stored as directories on a server
        ◦ domain – unique identifier for a site
        ◦ path – the files or directories inside of a subdomain
        ◦ query – passes data from the web page to the server; separated by a “?”
        ◦ parameters – listed inside query and separated by a “&”; format is id=[value]

    3. Common top-level domains
        ◦ top-level domain – the last part of the domain name
        ◦ .edu, .org, .net, .gov
    4. HTTP Request and HTTP Response
        ◦ request – from a client to a server;contains a url and a verb
        ◦ response – server returns a status code and a message body (contains parameters and html code that the browser knows how to display)
    5. HTTP status codes
        ◦ 1xx – informational responses
        ◦ 2xx – success
        ◦ 3xx – redirection
        ◦ 4xx – client errors
        ◦ 5xx – server errors
    6. HTTP verbs
        ◦ GET – simple browser requests (such as getting information about products)
        ◦ POST – data from submitted forms
        ◦ PUT and DELETE – not covered
    7. Client-side vs Server-side scripting, including common languages
        ◦ Client-side – 
            ▪ front end
            ▪ JavaScript or Jquery
            ▪ cannot access server resources
            ▪ often respond to user input (validating data, performing calculations, etc.)
            ▪ typically faster than back-end since don’t need to communicate with server
        ◦ Server-side – 
            ▪ back end
            ▪ various languages: PHP, Python, etc.
            ▪ interact with resources on a server (such as a database)
            ▪ typically handle HTTP requests and generate HTTP responses
