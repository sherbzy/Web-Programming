Module 6: LAMP
Note: this module was about going over the basics and did not include a coding project


LAMP Learning Goals
    1. The components of a LAMP stack
        ◦ Linux
        ◦ Apache
        ◦ MySQL
        ◦ PHP
    2. The role of each component
        ◦ Operating System (Linux)
        ◦ Web Server (Apache)
        ◦ Database (MySQL)
        ◦ Server-Side Script (PHP)
    3. The process from when a request is entered into the browser through when a response is displayed
        ◦ Apache web server receives requests for web pages from a user’s browser and, if the request is for a PHP file, passes the request to PHP 
        ◦ PHP loads the file and executes the code contained in the file communicating with MySQL when necessary to fetch data
        ◦ PHP then creates the HTML file and passes the result to the Apache web server to send to the browser
        ◦ All operations are enabled by Linux operating system which is running at the base of the stack
